Result-Based Re-Computation for Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using SVM Classification

Abstract-Medical treatment is a vital area of operation for
Cognitive intelligent systems. Machine learning algorithms
generate rapid disease prediction with high accuracy over a diverse
set of health datasets. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a
supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for
classification and regression tasks. Error-Tolerant is the most
difficult part of the SVM implementation. This is a problem when
using an SVM in safety-critical applications where a change in
classification result is not acceptable. In this proposed system,
Result-based Re-computation (RBR) is used as a productive
approach to protect SVMs from errors. RBR is an effective
technique for preserving SVMs from errors in the kernel function.
Based on the observation from the classification, the constraints
that impact the SVM result is recomputed for efficient fault
tolerance capability. Other machine learning classifierâ€™s results
were also compared and it was found that the RBR system with
SVM gave the highest accuracy with a filtered subset evaluator.
